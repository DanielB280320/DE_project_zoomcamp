- Note: To avoid conflicts problem when sending info. from our host/local machine to a remote Git Repository, is
        important to review that the data in our local is the same that is hosted in the Remote repository, and also
        we can add new info; For that its recommended first to make a copy of the repository in our local with 'Clone'
        to get the same info that is hosted in the Repo and also add new data to be sended.
